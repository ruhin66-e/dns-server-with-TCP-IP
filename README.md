<b>DNS (Domain Name System):</b> DNS servers translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the Internet. Itâ€™s like the phonebook of the Internet!<br>
<b>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):</b> TCP/IP is the core communication protocol of the Internet. TCP ensures reliable data transfer by breaking data into packets, sending them, and reassembling them. IP handles the addressing and routing of these packets to ensure they reach the correct destination.
